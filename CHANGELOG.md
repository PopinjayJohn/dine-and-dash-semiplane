# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

<!--
House rules:

  - `## [Unreleased]` is always the first section. Never retro-edit a released
    section; add a new version header instead.
  - Every commit that touches internal/, cmd/, plugins/, migrations/ or web/
    must touch this file in the same commit. scripts/check-changelog.sh fails
    the build otherwise.
  - Write entries for humans reading release notes, not for a git log. "Fixed
    the search" is not an entry; "search now ranks exact title matches first"
    is.
  - Each milestone from docs/spec.md lands its own section here, in the same
    commit as the code.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `wiki` command with `version` and `help` subcommands. The usage text is
  generated from the subcommand table, so a subcommand cannot exist without
  appearing in `wiki help`.
- `internal/version`, which reports the build version, commit, build date and
  Go toolchain. Every field is set with `-ldflags` at link time and defaults to
  `dev` and `unknown` so an unlinked build never claims to be a release.
- `wiki version` and `/healthz` report the same `version.Info` struct, so a
  bug report from a DM names the exact build.
- `.golangci.yml`, pinning the linter set: `errcheck`, `gosec` and
  `errorlint` for the access-control and error-handling invariants, plus
  formatting checks on `gofmt` and `goimports`.
- `wiki` returns an exit code of 0 on success and 1 on failure, decided by
  `exitCode` rather than by `os.Exit`, so the mapping is table-tested.

### Fixed

- A write to a closed stdout or stderr is now reported to the caller instead
  of being discarded. Previously `wiki help` could print a truncated page and
  exit 0.
- Pressing Ctrl-C no longer risks leaving the signal handler installed:
  `os.Exit` skipped the deferred cleanup, so `stop` is now called explicitly.

## [0.1.0] - TBD
